Hi! I like photography, reading, trekking (hiking), workout, computer games and cooking during my spare time. Feel free to have discussion if you are also interested in these hobbies!

#### Photography

I like tourism and thus I like taking photography to record the memorable scenes. Here are some of my favours:

#### Reading

I love reading, especially in history and politics. I also like reading fictions (e.g. internet fictions). Long time ago I also read books about philosophy and psychology since I wanted to pursue for a Bs.C. degree in philosophy (did not succeed :) ). Currently I am reading books about investiment (学点投资装作会富有） and Mao's selected works (毛选，强烈建议每个人都读读）.

#### Trekking (hiking)

This is the most expensive hobby lol. I spent a lot of money in all kinds of equipment like temp, hard shell, soft shell, GTX shoes, bags etc. 

I soloed a depopulated zone (72kms in 3 days) in Xinjiang in 2018 just after my bachelor graduation. Then I passed through the highest mountain in Guangdong. In the Spring festival 2022, I soloed Maclehose trail (100 kms) in 3 days with 18kg equipment. Then I passed through Lantau Trail, half by hiking and half by running.

#### Workout

I like weight training, especially in powerlifting. I started workout in 2021. I go to gym almost everyday. My personal record: deadlift 200kg, deep squat 170kg, bench press 90kg. My bodyweight is 80kg.
